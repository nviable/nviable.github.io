The DeFake project is an initiative by a team of researchers at the Global Cybersecurity
Institute at RIT and School of Journalism and Mass Communications at UofSC.

Deepfake technology has slashed the amount of knowledge and time it takes for bad actors to 
generate believable malicious video content. These videos could lead to disinformation campaigns 
attacking democracies and ruin reputations of high profile individuals. The faith of the public in 
the news media could erode if these videos are published. The DeFake project combines user studies 
with journalists as well as the latest in the AI research to develop a tool that would help the 
journalists detect these videos. The team are one of eight winners of the Knight Foundation's AI and the News Open Challenge.
