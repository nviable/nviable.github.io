Bibliomining is a process that is based on applying data mining techniques on vast amounts of library data to extract valuable behavioral patterns that would aid in decision making or greater efficiency of service [1]. Much of this evolved from the more recognized, Market Basket Analysis (MBA), primarily used in shopping malls for analysis of product associations. The paper discusses various stages and techniques used to mine the North South University (NSU) library data and extract useful patterns among the borrowers. The findings and results of this work can be used to accomplish more efficient management and budget allocation of the library.
