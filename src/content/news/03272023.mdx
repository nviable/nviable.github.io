We're hosting a 👨🏻‍🏫 Computing Organization for Multicultural Students (COMS) Workshop at RIT on March 27th, 2023. This will be interesting the event goes from 6:30 to 8:00pm, and I have to break my Ramadan fast at 7:31pm.

***Update*** The workshop went pretty well, I drank water to break my fast and had what felt like the best oatmeal raisin cookie ever. We also met some nice people at the club. It's a really nice initiative for people of color in computing at RIT, if you're reading this and you qualify, definitely get in touch with them.
