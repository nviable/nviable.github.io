Deep learning, part of artificial intelligence, is being used to create fake videos that look and sound like the real thing. But could this same artificial intelligence be used to turn the tables on these nefarious acts? In this edition of Intersections: The RIT Podcast, Professor Matthew Wright, director of RITâ€™s Center for Cybersecurity Research, talks with John Sohrawardi, a Ph.D. student in the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, about software they are creating that uses artificial intelligence to help journalists detect and root out deep fake videos.
