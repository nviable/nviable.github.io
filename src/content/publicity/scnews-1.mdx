I’m sitting in my office in Rock Hill, talking on Zoom with John Sohrawardi in Rochester, N.Y. Sohrawardi, a research student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, is running me through a game – it turns out I’m the first reporter to do so – to test how well I would vet something that, if true, would be a bombshell.

This is research for the DeFake project – a joint RIT/University of South Carolina project to develop an advanced, for-journalists-only deepfake detection software program.
