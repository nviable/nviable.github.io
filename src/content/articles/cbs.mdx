Facebook announced late Monday that it is banning certain types of so-called "deepfakes" â€” videos altered to appear as though people are doing or saying something they didn't actually do or say.

The policy marks the social media giant's first foray into regulating deepfakes, but it comes with caveats. Facebook Vice President Monika Bickert wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the ban won't apply to "parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words."

Facebook's moderators will remove videos edited through artificial intelligence or machine learning "in ways that aren't apparent to an average person and would likely mislead" viewers. Bickert did not describe how the company would assess an average person's understanding of altered videos.

The new policy swiftly drew criticism that it wouldn't have barred perhaps the most well-known recent example of an altered video to go viral. In May, a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi edited to make it seem as though she were slurring her words while speaking at a public event was viewed millions of times.
