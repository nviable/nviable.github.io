Much of this evolved from the more recognized, Market Basket Analysis (MBA), primarily used in shopping malls for analysis of product associations. The paper discusses various stages and techniques used to mine the North South University (NSU) library data and extract useful patterns among the borrowers. The findings and results of this work can be used to accomplish more efficient management and budget allocation of the library.\n<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6693969\">Link to paper</a></p>","frontmatter":{"authors":"Iftekhar Azam, Saniat Javid Sohrawardi, Himadree Shekhar Das, Md Samsul Alam, Md Saffan Alvy, Rashedur M Rahman","title":"Bibliomining on North South University library data","year":"2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/papers/2013-bibliomining-paper/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
