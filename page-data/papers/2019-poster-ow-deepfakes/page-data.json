Recently, so-called deepfake videos and images that are modified by or generated by artificial intelligence techniques have become more realistic and easier to create. These techniques could be used to create fake announcements from public figures or videos of events that did not happen, misleading mass audiences in dangerous ways.\nAlthough some recent research has examined accurate detection of deepfakes, those methodologies do not generalize well to realworld scenarios and are not available to the public in a usable form. In this project, we propose a system that will robustly and efficiently enable users to determine whether or not a video posted online is a deepfake. We approach the problem from the journalistsâ€™ perspective and work towards developing a tool to fit seamlessly into their workflow. Results demonstrate accurate detection on both within and mismatched datasets.\n<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saniat_Sohrawardi/publication/337092099_Poster_Towards_Robust_Open-World_Detection_of_Deepfakes/links/5e42daaa92851c7f7f2f86af/Poster-Towards-Robust-Open-World-Detection-of-Deepfakes.pdf\">Link to paper</a></p>","frontmatter":{"authors":"Saniat Javid Sohrawardi, Akash Chintha, Bao Thai, Sovantharith Seng, Andrea Hickerson, Raymond Ptucha, Matthew Wright","title":"Poster: Towards Robust Open-World Detection of Deepfakes","year":"2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/papers/2019-poster-ow-deepfakes/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
